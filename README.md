# LOCO-EFA-based leaf morphometry, automatic PCA graph creator and rudimentary model to predict species
Using lobe contribution elliptic fourier analysis to analyse leaf morphology, and (sort of) categorise by species
LOCO-EFA (Sanchez-Corrales et al. 2018) tries to explain an object's shape by using its outline. It addresses some of the downsides of regular EFA, you can read more about it in the original paper here https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29444894/
